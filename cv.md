## Objective  

Applying for a position of a Junior Front End Developper.

## Summary

During the past seven years, I have been working as a procurement engineer in the petrochemical construction industry. Although this role has been of great interest to me due to its potential to enhance interpersonal skills, I have recently been seeking a more flexible and creative career path. As a result, I have decided to pursue a career in web development, which I believe aligns well with my interests and aspirations.

My experience in a fast-paced procurement environment has allowed me to develop the ability to thrive under pressure, a skill that I believe will be valuable in the field of web development. I am confident that I will be able to acquire the necessary knowledge and skills to become a valuable member of any team.

I have also completed an online English proficiency test at www.efset.org, which demonstrates my advanced level of English language skills.
